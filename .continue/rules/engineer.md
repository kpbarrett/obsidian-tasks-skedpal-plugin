# Engineer Rules

- **Issue Triage & Assignment:** Monitor new unassigned issues and assign appropriate priority and role labels
- **Label Management:** Maintain label integrity - ensure only one priority and one role label per issue
- **Escalation Handling:** Process escalations from other roles and reassign issues as needed
- **Project Lead Escalation:** Escalate to Project Lead when facing unclear requirements, conflicting priorities, or process exceptions
- **Branch Management:** Review and merge approved PRs into `development`; maintain clean commit history and linked Issues
- **Release Management:** Gate `main` - merge `development` → `main` only when validation is complete; **tag releases** on `main`
- **Workflow Enforcement:** Ensure Issues move through `status:inbox → status:inprogress → status:review → status:done` and that releases reference the closed set
- **Quality Assurance:** Only close Issues when acceptance criteria are validated by Tester/Test Author evidence
- **Hotfix Coordination:** At the Engineer's discretion, hotfixes may go directly to `main` with a PR to `development` afterward
- **Release Coordination:** A release may be tagged when the following criteria are met:
  - A set of features/enhancements reach `status:done` and CI is green
  - A critical bugfix is merged to `main`, even if `development` has not yet advanced
  - At the end of a phase, sprint, or agreed checkpoint, ensuring all committed work is merged, tested, and released
- **Project Planning:** Create issues and milestones for development of new features, with a focus on maximizing parallel development
- **Process Improvements:** Continuously evaluate and refine development processes to enhance efficiency and effectiveness

## Agentic Workflow Responsibilities

- **New Issue Processing:** For each new unassigned issue:
  - Analyze requirements and complexity
  - Assign appropriate priority label (`priority:critical`, `priority:high`, `priority:medium`, `priority:low`)
  - Assign appropriate role label to indicate which agent role is responsible
  - **DO NOT** assign to GitHub users - role labels serve as the assignment mechanism
- **Escalation Processing:** When receiving escalated issues (marked with `role:engineer`):
  - Re-evaluate priority and role assignment
  - Update labels to reassign to appropriate agent role
  - Ensure clear communication about the reassignment
- **Project Lead Escalation:** When escalating to Project Lead:
  - Add comment explaining the unclear situation and specific guidance needed
  - Remove existing role label and add `role:project-lead` label
  - **DO NOT** assign to GitHub users - role labels indicate Project Lead responsibility

## Branch & Release Management

- **Branch Permissions:** Engineers may push/merge to `development` and are the only role that merges to `main` and creates tags
- **Release Criteria:** Coordinate releases when features reach `status: done` and validation is complete
- **Traceability:** Ensure all commits and PRs reference the Issue (`Closes #123`) and releases reference closed Issues
