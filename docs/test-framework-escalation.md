# Test Framework Escalation Process

## Overview

This document outlines the process for escalating test framework needs from Developers to Test Authors. This ensures that test infrastructure improvements are properly handled by the specialized Test Author role.

## When to Escalate

Developers should escalate to Test Authors when they encounter:

### 1. Test Framework Dependencies
- Need for new testing libraries (e.g., additional Playwright plugins)
- Missing test utilities or helpers
- Test environment configuration issues

### 2. Complex Testing Scenarios
- End-to-end tests spanning multiple features
- Performance or load testing requirements
- Cross-browser/platform compatibility testing
- Security testing needs

### 3. Test Infrastructure
- CI/CD test execution optimization
- Test reporting and analytics improvements
- Test data management solutions

## Escalation Process

### Step 1: Create GitHub Issue
- **Title**: Clear description of the test framework need
- **Labels**: `test-framework`, `priority: [low|medium|high]`
- **Assignee**: Test Author
- **Description**: Detailed explanation including:
  - What functionality needs testing
  - Current limitations with existing test framework
  - Proposed solution or requirements
  - Impact on development workflow

### Step 2: Issue Template
```markdown
## Test Framework Enhancement Request

**Developer Issue Reference**: #<original-issue-number>

**Testing Need**: 
[Describe the specific testing capability needed]

**Current Limitation**:
[Explain what's currently preventing proper testing]

**Proposed Solution**:
[Suggest possible approaches or requirements]

**Impact**:
[How this affects development velocity and quality]

**Priority**: [Low/Medium/High]
```

### Step 3: Test Author Response
- Acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
- Assess complexity and provide timeline
- Coordinate with Developer for requirements clarification
- Implement solution and update issue

## Examples

### Example 1: New Testing Library
```
Title: Add Playwright Visual Testing for UI Components
Labels: test-framework, priority: medium
Description: Need visual regression testing for Obsidian UI components. Current tests don't catch visual changes.
```

### Example 2: Test Infrastructure
```
Title: Optimize Test Execution Time in CI
Labels: test-framework, priority: high  
Description: Current test suite takes 15+ minutes. Need parallel execution and test optimization.
```

### Example 3: Complex E2E Testing
```
Title: Create E2E Test for Full Synchronization Workflow
Labels: test-framework, priority: high
Description: Need comprehensive test covering Obsidian → SkedPal → Obsidian sync cycle.
```

## Success Metrics

- Reduced time from escalation to resolution
- Improved test coverage for complex scenarios
- Faster test execution times
- Fewer test-related development blockers

## Review Process

This escalation process should be reviewed quarterly to ensure:
- Timely response to framework requests
- Appropriate prioritization of test infrastructure work
- Continuous improvement of test capabilities
