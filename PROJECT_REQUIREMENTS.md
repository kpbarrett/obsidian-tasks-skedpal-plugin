# Project Requirements - obsidian-tasks-skedpal-plugin

## Overview
This document serves as the single source of truth for all project requirements. The multi-agent development system will reference this document to generate and prioritize tasks.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Obsidian Integration
- **REQ-001**: Plugin must integrate with Obsidian's task management system
- **REQ-002**: Support for reading and writing tasks from Obsidian vaults
- **REQ-003**: Real-time synchronization with Obsidian task updates

### 2. SkedPal Integration
- **REQ-004**: Bidirectional synchronization with SkedPal scheduling system
- **REQ-005**: Support for SkedPal's time blocking and scheduling features
- **REQ-006**: Authentication and API integration with SkedPal

### 3. User Experience
- **REQ-011**: Simple configuration and setup process
- **REQ-012**: Clear status indicators for synchronization
- **REQ-013**: Error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Technical Requirements

### 4. Performance
- **REQ-014**: Synchronization should complete within 30 seconds for typical vaults
- **REQ-015**: Plugin should not significantly impact Obsidian performance
- **REQ-016**: Efficient memory usage for large task lists

### 5. Reliability
- **REQ-017**: Data integrity must be maintained during synchronization
- **REQ-018**: Graceful handling of network interruptions
- **REQ-019**: Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits

## Development Requirements

### 6. Testing
- **REQ-020**: Comprehensive unit test coverage (>80%)
- **REQ-021**: Integration tests for Obsidian and SkedPal APIs
- **REQ-022**: End-to-end testing of synchronization workflow

### 7. Documentation
- **REQ-023**: Clear installation and setup instructions
- **REQ-024**: API documentation for extension developers
- **REQ-025**: Troubleshooting guide for common issues

### 8. Multi-Agent System Requirements
- **REQ-007**: Four-agent architecture (Developer, Tester, Engineer, General)
- **REQ-008**: Task routing based on task type and agent specialization
- **REQ-009**: Automated task processing workflow
- **REQ-010**: Progress monitoring and reporting capabilities

## Priority Matrix

| Requirement | Priority | Status      | Agent Responsible |
|-------------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| REQ-001     | High     | In Progress | Developer         |
| REQ-007     | High     | Completed   | General           |
| REQ-008     | High     | Completed   | Orchestrator      |
| REQ-004     | Medium   | Planned     | Developer         |
| REQ-020     | Medium   | Planned     | Tester            |
