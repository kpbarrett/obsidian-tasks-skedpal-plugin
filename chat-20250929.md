# Chat Log Summary â€“ Fixing Issue #7 in `obsidian-tasks-skedpal-plugin`

## Context
The conversation focused on resolving **Issue #7** in the GitHub repository [`obsidian-tasks-skedpal-plugin`](https://github.com/kpbarrett/obsidian-tasks-skedpal-plugin/issues/7).  
This issue required updating the **test suite** to fully support the new **Obsidian API integration** implemented in PR #6.

---

## Issue #7 Overview
- **Title**: Update test suite for REQ-001 Obsidian integration  
- **Problem**:  
  - Tests fail because the Obsidian API (particularly `MetadataCache` and `CachedMetadata`) isnâ€™t mocked.  
  - Existing mocks donâ€™t include full coverage for the metadata cache.  
  - Task detection relies on metadata cache, but tests lack it.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**:  
  - Add proper mocking for `app.metadataCache.getFileCache()`.  
  - Mock list items with task properties.  
  - Add tests for both metadata cache availability and fallback parsing.  
  - Cover Tasks plugin integration scenarios.  
  - Ensure both cache and manual parsing paths work.  
- **Priority**: Medium  
- **Labels**: `testing`, `REQ-001`, `test-author`

## Project Structure Insights
- **Directories**: `plugin-obsidian/src`, `tests`, `ops`, `docs`, etc.  
- **Relevant Test Files**:  
  - `tests/obsidian-mocks.ts` â€“ provides a mock implementation of Obsidian API classes (`MockApp`, `MockVault`, `MockNotice`, `MockPlugin`, etc.).  
  - `tests/obsidian-integration.spec.ts` â€“ contains detailed tests for task parsing and integration.  
  - `tests/mock-validation.spec.ts` â€“ validates the mock environment itself.  
  - `tests/setup.ts` â€“ sets up Playwright with global Obsidian mocks.  

---

## Key Findings in Tests
- **Mocks**:  
  - `MockApp` included `metadataCache`, but only returned `null`.  
  - `MockVault` simulated file operations with tasks.  
  - `MockNotice` captured UI notices.  
- **Integration Tests**:  
  - Verified task detection from Markdown files.  
  - Confirmed parsing of priorities `(A)`, due dates `ðŸ“… yyyy-mm-dd`, and tags `#tag`.  
  - Checked `includeCompletedTasks` setting.  
  - Verified task IDs, updates, metadata extraction, and multiple formats.  
  - Confirmed plugin initialization and file modification handling.  

**Gap**: No tests for `metadataCache` integration (mock existed but unused).

---

## Next Steps (Implied by Discussion)
1. Extend `MockApp.metadataCache.getFileCache()` to return cached list items.  
2. Write new tests verifying:  
   - Tasks are detected via cache when available.  
   - Fallback works when cache is unavailable.  
   - Tasks plugin API is supported.  
3. Ensure regression tests still pass.  

---

## Conclusion
The session successfully identified what was missing in the test suite: **metadata cache support and related test cases**. The path forward is to expand `obsidian-mocks.ts`, update `obsidian-integration.spec.ts`, and add scenarios for cache vs. fallback behavior.  

This summary provides a reduced version of the chat log so development can resume efficiently in a new session.
