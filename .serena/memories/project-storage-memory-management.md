# Project Storage Memory Management

## Overview
This memory documents the process and conventions for storing memories in project storage within the `.serena/memories` directory.

## Storage Location
- **Directory**: `.serena/memories/`
- **File Format**: Markdown (.md)
- **Naming Convention**: kebab-case with descriptive names

## Current Memory Files
- `agent-system-implementation-guide.md`
- `json-file-creation-skill.md`

## Memory Creation Process
1. Memories are stored as markdown files in `.serena/memories/`
2. Each memory file should have a clear, descriptive name
3. Content should be structured with headers for easy navigation
4. Include relevant metadata and context for future reference

## Usage Guidelines
- Memories should capture important project decisions, configurations, and learnings
- Use clear section headers to organize content
- Include relevant file paths, patterns, and implementation details
- Reference related memories when applicable
