# Agent System Implementation Guide

## Overview
Successfully implemented a four-agent task processing system with specialized agents: Developer, Tester, Engineer, and General.

## Key Components

### Agent Architecture
- **Developer Agent**: Handles `implement-feature` and `fix-bug` tasks
- **Tester Agent**: Executes `run-test` tasks and records results  
- **Engineer Agent**: Analyzes `analyze-test-results` and creates follow-up tasks
- **General Agent**: Handles `coordinate-workflow` and `monitor-progress` tasks
- **Orchestrator**: Routes tasks to appropriate agents based on type or explicit assignment

### File Structure
```

├── orchestrator.js    # Task routing logic
├── developer.js       # Feature/bug implementation
├── tester.js          # Test execution
├── engineer.js        # Analysis and task generation
└── general.js         # Coordination and monitoring

ops/
├── jobs/
│   ├── inbox/         # New jobs waiting processing
│   ├── working/       # Jobs being retried after failure
│   └── done/          # Successfully completed jobs
└── reports/
    └── YYYY-MM-DD/    # Dated report directories
        └── summary.jsonl  # Task execution logs
```

### Task Format
```json
{
  "id": "unique-task-identifier",
  "type": "task-type",
  "title": "Descriptive title",
  "agent": "optional-agent-name",
  "priority": "low|normal|high|urgent",
  "requires": ["path/to/required/file"],
  "notes": "Additional context",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601-timestamp"
}
```

### Processing Workflow
1. Tasks placed in `ops/jobs/inbox/` as JSON files
2. Orchestrator routes to appropriate agent based on task type
3. Agent executes task-specific logic
4. Results recorded in dated report directories
5. Successful tasks moved to `ops/jobs/done/`, failed to `ops/jobs/working/`

### Documentation Created
- `README.md` - Updated with agent system overview
- `docs/agent-system.md` - Comprehensive architecture documentation
- `docs/workflow-diagram.md` - Visual workflow with Mermaid
- `docs/task-templates.md` - Templates for all agent types
- Updated `Makefile` with agent-specific commands

### Key Commands
```bash
make agent-test        # Test agent system functionality
make agent-docs        # View agent documentation  
make agent-status      # Show current system status
make agent-process     # Process next task using agent system
```

### Best Practices
- Use descriptive task titles and unique IDs following naming conventions
- Include all required dependencies in `requires` array
- Set appropriate priority levels based on task importance
- Provide clear context in `notes` field for agent understanding
- Monitor report files for system health and task progress

### Error Handling
- Failed tasks remain in working directory for manual intervention
- System continues processing other tasks
- Detailed error information recorded in reports
- Backward compatible with existing task structure

### Extensibility
- Easy to add new agents by creating files in `scripts/agents/`
- Simple to add new task types by updating orchestrator routing
- Comprehensive test suite for verification
- Well-documented architecture for maintenance
