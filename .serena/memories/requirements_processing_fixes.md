# Requirements-Driven Processing Fixes

## Issue Identified
The original requirements-driven processing system was incorrectly rubber-stamping tasks as "done" immediately instead of creating proper task files in `ops/jobs/inbox` for workflow processing.

## Root Cause
The orchestrator was directly processing tasks through agents instead of creating task files that could be processed by the `process_next_task.js` workflow system.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Modified Orchestrator (`scripts/agents/orchestrator.js`)
- Replaced direct task processing with task file creation
- Added `createTaskFile()` method to generate proper task files
- Task files are now created in `ops/jobs/inbox` with correct structure

### 2. Updated Task Structure
Tasks now include:
- Unique task ID based on requirement ID and timestamp
- Proper task type mapping (implement-feature, run-test, etc.)
- Descriptive title with requirement ID and description
- Feature description from requirement
- Requirement reference for traceability
- Priority level from requirements
- Assigned agent based on task type
- Status and creation timestamp

### 3. Workflow Integration
- Tasks are now properly queued in `ops/jobs/inbox`
- Can be processed sequentially by `scripts/process_next_task.js`
- Follows established workflow: inbox → processing → done/working
- Maintains proper status tracking and reporting

## Verification
- Successfully created 25 task files from 25 requirements
- Task files have correct structure matching existing workflow
- System ready for proper agent-based processing

## Key Learning
Requirements-driven processing should create task files for workflow processing, not immediately execute tasks. This maintains the integrity of the multi-agent workflow system.
