# Four-Agent System Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented and documented a sophisticated four-agent task processing system with specialized agents: Developer, Tester, Engineer, and General. This system replaces the previous simple task processing with intelligent agent-based workflow management.

## Implementation Details

### Agent Architecture
- **Developer Agent** (`scripts/agents/developer.js`): Handles `implement-feature` and `fix-bug` tasks
- **Tester Agent** (`scripts/agents/tester.js`): Executes `run-test` tasks and records results in `ops/reports/test-results/`
- **Engineer Agent** (`scripts/agents/engineer.js`): Analyzes `analyze-test-results` and creates follow-up tasks based on test outcomes
- **General Agent** (`scripts/agents/general.js`): Handles `coordinate-workflow` and `monitor-progress` tasks, acts as default for unknown types
- **Orchestrator** (`scripts/agents/orchestrator.js`): Intelligent task routing based on task type or explicit agent assignment

### Key Features Implemented
- **Automatic Task Routing**: Tasks are automatically routed to appropriate agents based on type
- **Explicit Agent Assignment**: Tasks can explicitly specify which agent should handle them
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed execution logs with timestamps in dated directories
- **Error Recovery**: Failed tasks moved to working directory for retry, system continues processing others
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing tasks continue to work with the new system
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add new agents and task types

### File Structure Created

├── tester.js          # Test execution and result recording
├── engineer.js        # Test analysis and task generation
└── general.js         # Coordination and monitoring tasks

├── jobs/
│   ├── inbox/         # New jobs waiting processing (JSON files)
│   ├── working/       # Jobs being retried after failure

└── reports/
    └── YYYY-MM-DD/    # Dated report directories
        └── summary.jsonl  # Task execution logs in JSONL format
```

### Task Processing Workflow
1. **Task Creation**: JSON task files placed in `ops/jobs/inbox/`
2. **Task Selection**: `scripts/process_next_task.js` processes tasks in lexicographical order
3. **Agent Routing**: Orchestrator determines appropriate agent based on task type
4. **Task Execution**: Agent-specific logic executed with proper error handling
5. **Result Recording**: Detailed reports created in dated directories
6. **Task Completion**: Successful tasks moved to `done/`, failed to `working/`

### Documentation Created
- **README.md**: Updated with agent system overview and usage instructions
- **docs/agent-system.md**: Comprehensive architecture documentation
- **docs/workflow-diagram.md**: Visual workflow with Mermaid diagram
- **docs/task-templates.md**: Complete task templates for all agent types
- **Makefile**: Enhanced with agent-specific commands

### New Commands Available
```bash
make agent-test        # Test agent system functionality
make agent-docs        # View agent documentation
make agent-status      # Show current system status (task counts, latest reports)
make agent-process     # Process next task using agent system (alias for process-next-task)
```

### Task Format Standard
```json
{
  \"id\": \"unique-task-identifier\",
  \"type\": \"task-type\",
  \"title\": \"Descriptive title\",
  \"agent\": \"optional-agent-name\",
  \"priority\": \"low|normal|high|urgent\",
  \"requires\": [\"path/to/required/file\"],
  \"notes\": \"Additional context\",
  \"timestamp\": \"ISO-8601-timestamp\"
}
```

### Testing Implementation
- Updated `tests/stub.spec.ts` to test agent-based task processing
- Tests verify correct routing of tasks to appropriate agents
- Tests both automatic and explicit agent assignment
- Comprehensive test coverage for agent system functionality

### Best Practices Established
- **Task Naming**: Use descriptive titles and follow ID naming conventions (feat-, bug-, test-, etc.)
- **Dependency Management**: List all required files in `requires` array
- **Priority Setting**: Assign appropriate priority levels based on task importance
- **Context Provision**: Provide clear context in `notes` field for agent understanding
- **Monitoring**: Regularly check report files for system health and progress

### Error Handling Strategy
- Failed tasks remain in `ops/jobs/working/` for manual intervention
- System continues processing other tasks to maintain workflow
- Detailed error information recorded in reports for debugging
- Graceful degradation ensures system reliability

### Extensibility Features
- **New Agents**: Easy to add by creating files in `scripts/agents/` with standard interface
- **New Task Types**: Simple to add by updating orchestrator routing logic
- **Modular Design**: Each agent has clear responsibilities and can be modified independently
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Well-documented architecture for maintenance and extension

## Implementation Status
✅ **Complete**: All four agents implemented and tested  
✅ **Documented**: Comprehensive documentation created  
✅ **Integrated**: Updated task processor and test suite  
✅ **Ready for Use**: System fully operational and ready for task processing

## Next Steps
- Begin creating tasks using templates in `docs/task-templates.md`
- Use `make agent-process` to start processing tasks
- Monitor system performance through report files
- Extend system by adding new agents or task types as needed
