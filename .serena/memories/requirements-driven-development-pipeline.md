# Requirements-Driven Development Pipeline

## Overview
This memory documents the implementation of a requirements-driven development pipeline for the multi-agent system, using `PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md` as the single source of truth.

## Key Components

### Requirements Document
- **File**: `PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md`
- **Purpose**: Single source of truth for all project requirements
- **Format**: Structured markdown with requirement IDs, descriptions, priorities
- **Structure**: Core requirements, technical requirements, development requirements

### Requirements Parser
- **File**: `scripts/requirements/parser.js`
- **Functionality**: Parses requirements from markdown format
- **Features**: Extracts requirement IDs, descriptions, priorities, status
- **Integration**: Updates requirement status automatically

### Task Generator
- **File**: `scripts/requirements/task-generator.js`
- **Functionality**: Generates tasks from requirements
- **Mapping**: Requirements → Task types → Agents
- **Prioritization**: Based on requirement priority

### Enhanced Orchestrator
- **File**: `scripts/agents/orchestrator.js`
- **Enhancements**: Requirements-driven processing mode
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains original single-task processing
- **New Flag**: `--requirements` for automated task generation

## Workflow Integration

### Processing Modes
1. **Requirements-Driven**: `node scripts/agents/orchestrator.js --requirements`
2. **Single Task**: `node scripts/agents/orchestrator.js '{\"type\":\"implement-feature\"}'`
3. **Manual**: Create JSON files in `ops/tasks/inbox/`

### Agent Specialization
- **Developer**: Feature implementation and bug fixes
- **Tester**: Test execution and validation
- **Engineer**: Results analysis and corrective tasks
- **General**: Workflow coordination and monitoring

## Benefits Achieved

### Automation
- Reduced manual task creation
- Automated prioritization based on requirements
- Status synchronization between requirements and tasks

### Traceability
- Full audit trail from requirements to implementation
- Real-time progress tracking
- Automated documentation updates

### Alignment
- All work directly ties back to requirements
- Clear visibility into requirements coverage
- Better project planning and estimation

## Implementation Details

### Requirement Format
```markdown
- **REQ-XXX**: Description of requirement
```

### Priority Matrix
Automatically updated in requirements document showing:
- Requirement ID
- Priority (High/Medium/Low)
- Status (Planned/In Progress/Completed)
- Agent responsible

### File Structure
```
PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md
scripts/requirements/
  parser.js
  task-generator.js
scripts/agents/
  orchestrator.js (enhanced)
  developer.js
  tester.js
  engineer.js
  general.js
WORKFLOW_DOCUMENTATION.md
```

## Usage Guidelines

### Adding New Requirements
1. Edit `PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md`
2. Add requirement with unique ID (REQ-XXX)
3. Set priority and status
4. Run requirements pipeline

### Monitoring Progress
- Check priority matrix in requirements document
- Review dated reports in `ops/reports/`
- Track task status in `ops/tasks/` directories
